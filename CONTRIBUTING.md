# Contributing to GitTracker 🤝

We love your input! We want to make contributing to GitTracker as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/sagarit-code/git-tracker/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.
6.  Issue that pull request!
